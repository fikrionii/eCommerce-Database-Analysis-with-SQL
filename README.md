**Objectives**

- Tell the story of the company's growth, using trended performance data
- Use the database to explain some of the details around the company's growth story
- Analyze current performance and use the data available to assess upcoming opportunities

**Problem Questions**

1. Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our busienss. Could you pull **monthly trends** for **gsearch sessions and orders** so that we can showcase the growth there?

2. Next, it would be great to see a similar trend for gsearch, but this time **splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately**. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

3. While we're on gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull **monthly sessions and orders split by device type**? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.

4. I'm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from gsearch. Can you pull **monthly trends for gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?**

5. I'd like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull **session to order conversion rates, by month**?

6. For the gsearch lander test, please **estimate the revenue that test earned us** (**Hint:** Look at the increase in CVR from the test (JUn 19 - Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

7. For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to shows a **full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders**. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 - Jul 28).

8. I'd love for you to **quantify the impact of our billing test**, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 - Nov 10), in terms of **revenue per billing page sessions**, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.

## Insight and Visualization üìà

### ‚úí Q1: Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our busienss. Could you pull **monthly trends** for **gsearch sessions and orders** so that we can showcase the growth there?

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM website_sessions.created_at) AS yearmonth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) /
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) * 100.0, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1;
```

### ‚úí Q2: Next, it would be great to see a similar trend for gsearch, but this time **splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately**. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.
